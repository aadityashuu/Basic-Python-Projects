This file contains the documentation for Command-Line.

Hello, this project is a very simple implementation of Shell?Command-Prompt. The name of the projet is
Command-Line. 
Command-Line basically has a set of instructions that it can understand, and gives an output accordingly.

This files also contains the list of commands that can be used by a user while working with the Command-Line.

List of Commands : 
---------------------

!help -> Prints the Help Page on Interface.
!quit -> CLoses the Command-Line.
!hello -> Print a simple Grreting Message.

NOTE :
All Commands start with a "!" Exclaimation Sign. <<IMPORTANT**>>
Try to enter commands in Lower Case. Although, the Command-Line can take input in Upper-Case also.



This file will be updated as I add new commands to the Command-Line in the future.**
